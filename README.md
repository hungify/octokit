# Octokit

My research on the Octokit SDK for GitHub API.

## All Repositories

1. [openapi-types.ts](https://github.com/octokit/openapi-types.ts)

> Generated TypeScript definitions based on GitHub's OpenAPI spec

2. [types.ts](https://github.com/octokit/types.ts)

> Shared TypeScript definitions for Octokit projects

3. [endpoint.js](https://github.com/octokit/endpoint.js)

> Turns REST API endpoints into generic request options

4. [request.js](https://github.com/octokit/request.js)

> Send parameterized requests to GitHubâ€™s APIs

## Overview

Typically, developers of such applications want to:

- Use TypeScript interfaces to model data for their APIs
- Send and fetch this data from server in a typesafe way
- Build further abstractions on top of this data
